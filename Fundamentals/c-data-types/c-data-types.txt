C Data Types
- In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. 
- This determines the type and size of data associated with variables. 

For example:
- int myVar;
 => myVar is a variable of int(integer) type.
 => The size of int is 4 bytes.

Basic types
Here's a table containing commonly used types in C programming for quick access.

Type	                Size (bytes)	                    Format Specifier
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int	                    at least 2, usually 4	                %d, %i
char	                1	                                    %c
float	                4	                                    %f
double	                8	                                    %lf
short int	            2 usually	                            %hd
unsigned int	        at least 2, usually 4	                %u
long int	            at least 4, usually 8	                %ld, %li
long long int	        at least 8	                            %lld, %lli
unsigned long int	    at least 4	                            %lu
unsigned long long int	at least 8	                            %llu
signed char	            1	                                    %c
unsigned char	        1	                                    %c
long double	            at least 10, usually 12 or 16	        %Lf


int
- Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative 
values but no decimal values. 

For example:
-> , 0, -5, 10

- We can use int for declaring an integer variable.
- int id;
 => id is a variable of type integer.
- You can declare multiple variables at once in C programming.
E.g:
- int id, age;
- The size of int is usually 4 bytes (32 bits). 
--- And, it can take 232 distinct states from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

float and double
- float and double are used to hold real numbers.
-> float salary;
-> double price;

In C, floating-point numbers can also be represented in exponential. 
For example:
- float normalizationFactor = 22.442e2;

What's the difference between float and double?
- The size of float (single precision float data type) is 4 bytes. 
- And the size of double (double precision float data type) is 8 bytes.

char
Keyword char is used for declaring character type variables. 

For example:
- char test = 'h';
-- Size of the character variable is 1 byte.

void
- void is an incomplete type. 
- It means "nothing" or "no type". 
--- You can think of void as absent.

For example:
- If a function is not returning anything, its return type should be void.

Note that:
- You cannot create variables of void type.

short and long
- If you need to use a large number, you can use a type specifier long. 

Here's how:
long a;
long long b;
long double c;
- Here variables a and b can store integer values. 
And, c can store a floating-point number.

- If you are sure, only a small integer ([âˆ’32,767, +32,767] range) will be used, 
you can use short.
-- short d;

- You can always check the size of a variable using the sizeof() operator.:

#include <stdio.h>      
int main() {
  short a;
  long b;
  long long c;
  long double d;

  printf("size of short = %d bytes\n", sizeof(a));
  printf("size of long = %d bytes\n", sizeof(b));
  printf("size of long long = %d bytes\n", sizeof(c));
  printf("size of long double= %d bytes\n", sizeof(d));
  return 0;
}
